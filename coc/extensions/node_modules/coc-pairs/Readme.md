# coc-pairs

Auto pair extension for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).

**Note** you should disable/remove other auto pair plugin for this extension
work as expected.

**Note** when you type paired character which is just next character, it would
just move to right by one column.

**Note** when the previous characters ends with two of inserting character, the
character would just inserted without insert paired character, this makes insert
triple quotes easier.

**Note** for `<` to insert paired `>`, the previous character should not be
empty space.
